Models and Repositories
In the realm of PostgreSQL, we manipulate tables, column names and records. However, in Python programs, we represent data using classes, objects and attributes. We therefore need a way to transform the data retrieved from the database into data that can be used in our program.

To achieve this, you will learn how to build two kind of classes â€” they're regular Python classes, but designed to achieve a specific purpose in our program:

A Model class is used to hold a record's data.
For example, if we have a table artists, we'd have a class Artist, with attributes for each column. A single object holds the data for a specific artist record. This class usually doesn't contain any logic, but is only used to hold data.

A Repository class implements methods to run SQL queries on the database to retrieve, create, update or delete data.
For example, if we have one table artists, we'd have a class ArtistRepository containing methods that communicates with the database using SQL.
