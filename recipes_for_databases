********Single table design recipe**********

1. First extract the nouns:
 # EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here, the final line).
As a music lover,
So I can organise my records,
I want to keep a list of albums' titles.
As a music lover,
So I can organise my records,
I want to keep a list of albums' release years.
Nouns:
album, title, release year

2. Infer the Table Name and Columns
Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.
Record	Properties
album	title, release year
Name of the table (always plural): albums
Column names: title, release_year


3 Decide Colum Types
Most of the time, you'll need either text, int, bigint, numeric, or boolean. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.
Remember to always have the primary key id as a first column. Its type will always be SERIAL.
# EXAMPLE:
id: SERIAL
title: text
release_year: int

4. Write the SQL
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: albums_table.sql
-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.
CREATE TABLE albums (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  release_year int
);

5. Create the table
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
